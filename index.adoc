== What is GitOps?

* Describe your desired software system as files stored in git
* An agent ensures the live system is the same as the state in Git

=== History of GitOps

* First published by Weaveworks 
* https://www.weave.works/blog/kubernetes-anti-patterns-let-s-do-gitops-not-ciops[Kubernetes anti-patterns: Let's do GitOps not CiOps]

==== Typical CI pipeline

image::typical_CI_pipeline.png[]

=== What do you need for GitOps?

[%step]
. Git repository
. Agent
. Kubernetes cluster

=== Other useful stuff

[%step]
* Manifest generation tool
* CI system
* Web UI

=== Benefits of GitOps

* Single source of truth
* Security, compliance and auditing
* Developer centric
* Trivializes rollback
* Declaritive
* Observable - detect configuration drift
* Velocity
 
== How does GitOps actually work?

=== CI/CD

=== Git commits are signals 

[%step]
* Build triggered by commit to **Code** repo
* Deployment triggered by commit to **Config** repo
* Separate repos? (In the beginning maybe)

=== Code + chart in same repo?

* This is how we started

$ kubectl get application ops-demo1 -oyaml | yq r - spec.source
helm:
  values: |
    ingress:
      hostname: ops-demo1.us.teamworkops.com
    opsdemo1:
      replicaCount: 3
    config:
      HELLO: "world"
      HOLA: "mundo"
path: chart
repoURL: git@github.com:Teamwork/ops-demo1.git

=== Best practices

[%step]
. Two repos: One for code the other for deployment
. Chose the right number of deployment repos
. Test your manifests before you commit
. Git manifests should not change to to external influences
. Plan how you'll manage secrets

== Thought this talk was about Argo CD?

=== Tour of the UI

https://argocd.us.teamworkops.com

[%step]
. SSO enabled
. Multi-tenanted 
. Visual map of application components
. Status
. Inspect Yaml and logs
. Delete objects
. Change app settings

=== Demo: Build and deploy

* Commit a change and watch it get built and deployed
